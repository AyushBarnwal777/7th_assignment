    "Abstraction is one of the fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It refers to the concept of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. Abstraction allows you to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it. It helps in simplifying the complexity of a system by breaking it down into manageable parts."
